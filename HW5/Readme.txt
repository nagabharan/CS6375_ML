Report.docx contains the comprehensive table of outputs and observations.

Classifiers:
	1. kNN
	2. Bagging
	3. Boosting
	4. Random Forest
	5. Gradient Boosting

Datasets:
	1. Indian Liver Patient Dataset(ILPD)
	2. Cleveland Heart Disease Processed
	3. Breast Cancer Diagnostic Wisconsin
	4. Wine Dataset
	5. Ionosphere Dataset

To Run: 
	Rscript Dataset#.R where # is 1-5.
NOTE:
	If the packages required for running are not present then the require condition inside the code will install the packages.

	Once you run the script from command line, the accuracy arrays and average accuracy will be stored in a .txt file for each dataset as "Output #.txt"

	Each time you run the script, the results will be overwritten with new results.
